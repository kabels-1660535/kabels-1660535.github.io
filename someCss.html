		To the right of this text, I posted a picture of Dubs taken from his Twitter account. The image appears to the right of this text because I had the image floated so that it would be on the right side of the page. Additionally, the image does not normally have rounded border corners but does on this page because I also rounded the corners of the image on top of having it float. All of these changes as well as the background color and color of the text appear in the external CSS file attached to this HTML file. If this text was longer, it would continue to wrap around the image that has been floated.
